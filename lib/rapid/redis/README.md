redis - a node redis client
===========================

This is a Redis client for node.  It is designed for node 0.2.1+ and redis 2.0.1+.  It probably won't work on earlier versions of either.

Most Redis commands are implemented, including MULTI.  The notable exceptions are PUBLISH/SUBSCRIBE, and WATCH/UNWATCH.
These should be coming soon.

## Why?

`node_redis` works in the latest versions of node, is published in `npm`, and is very fast.

The most popular Redis client, `redis-node-client` by fictorial, is very mature and well tested.  If you are running an older version
of node or value the maturity and stability of `redis-node-client`, I encourage you to use that one instead.

`node_redis` is designed with performance in mind.  The included `test.js` runs similar tests to `redis-benchmark`, included with the Redis 
distribution, and `test.js` is faster than `redis-benchmarks` for some patterns and slower for others.  `node_redis` is roughly 6X faster at
these benchmarks than `redis-node-client`.

## Usage

Simple example, included as `example.js`:

    var redis = require("redis"),
        client = redis.createClient();

    client.set("string key", "string val", redis.print);
    client.hset("hash key", "hashtest 1", "some value", redis.print);
    client.hset(["hash key", "hashtest 2", "some other value"], redis.print);
    client.hkeys("hash key", function (err, replies) {
        console.log(replies.length + " replies:");
        replies.forEach(function (reply, i) {
            console.log("    " + i + ": " + reply);
        });
        client.end();
    });

This will display:

    mjr:~/work/node_redis (master)$ node example.js 
    Reply: OK
    Reply: 0
    Reply: 0
    2 replies:
        0: hashtest 1
        1: hashtest 2
    mjr:~/work/node_redis (master)$ 


### Sending Commands

Each Redis command is exposed as a function on the `client` object.
All functions take either take either an `args` Array plus optional `callback` Function or
a variable number of individual arguments followed by an optional callback.
Here is an example of passing an array of arguments and a callback:

    client.mset(["test keys 1", "test val 1", "test keys 2", "test val 2"], function (err, res) {});

Here is that same call in the second style:

    client.mset("test keys 1", "test val 1", "test keys 2", "test val 2", function (err, res) {});
    
Note that in either form the `callback` is optional:

    client.set("some key", "some val");
    client.set(["some other key", "some val"]);

For a list of Redis commands, see [Redis Command Reference](http://code.google.com/p/redis/wiki/CommandReference)

The commands can be specified in uppercase or lowercase for convenience.  `client.get()` is the same as `clieint.GET()`.

Minimal parsing is done on the replies.  Commands that return a single line reply return JavaScript Strings, 
integer replies return JavaScript Numbers, "bulk" replies return node Buffers, and "multi bulk" replies return a 
JavaScript Array of node Buffers.  `HGETALL` returns an Object with Buffers keyed by the hash keys.

`MULTI` is supported.  The syntax is a little awkward:

    client.multi([
        ["incr", ["multibar"], function (err, res) {
            console.log(err || res);
        }],
        ["incr", ["multifoo"], function (err, res) {
            console.log(err || res);
        }]
    ]);

`MULTI` takes an Array of 3-element Arrays.  The elements are: `command`, `args`, `callback`.
When the commands are all submitted, `EXEC` is called and the callbacks are invoked in order.
If a command is submitted that doesn't pass the syntax check, it will be removed from the
transaction.

I guess we also need a callback when `MULTI` finishes, in case the last command gets removed from an error.

# API

## Events

`client` will emit some events about the state of the connection to the Redis server.

### "connect"

`client` will emit `connect` when a connection is established to the Redis server.

### "error"

`client` will emit `error` when encountering an error connecting to the Redis server.

### "end"

`client` will emit `end` when an established Redis server connection has closed.

## redis.createClient(port, host)

Create a new client connection.  `port` defaults to `6379` and `host` defaults
to `127.0.0.1`.  If you have Redis running on the same computer as node, then the defaults are probably fine.

`createClient` returns a `RedisClient` object that is named `client` in all of the examples here.


## client.end()

Close the connection to the Redis server.  Note that this does not wait until all replies have been parsed.
If you want to exit cleanly, call `client.end()` in the reply callback of your last command:

    var redis = require("redis"),
        client = redis.createClient();

    client.on("connect", function () {
        client.set("foo_rand000000000000", "some fantastic value");
        client.get("foo_rand000000000000", function (err, reply) {
            console.log(reply.toString());
            client.end();
        });
    });

## redis.print()

A handy callback function for displaying return values when testing.  Example:

    var redis = require("redis"),
        client = redis.createClient();

    client.on("connect", function () {
        client.set("foo_rand000000000000", "some fantastic value", redis.print);
        client.get("foo_rand000000000000", redis.print);
    });

This will print:

    Reply: OK
    Reply: some fantastic value

Note that this program will not exit cleanly because the client is still connected.

## redis.debug_mode

Boolean to enable debug mode and protocol tracing.

    var redis = require("redis"),
        client = redis.createClient();

    redis.debug_mode = true;

    client.on("connect", function () {
        client.set("foo_rand000000000000", "some fantastic value");
    });

This will display:

    mjr:~/work/node_redis (master)$ node ~/example.js 
    send command: *3
    $3
    SET
    $20
    foo_rand000000000000
    $20
    some fantastic value

    on_data: +OK

`send command` is data sent into Redis and `on_data` is data received from Redis.

## client.send_command(command_name, args, callback)

Used internally to send commands to Redis.  For convenience, nearly all commands that are published on the Redis 
Wiki have been added to the `client` object.  However, if I missed any, or if new commands are introduced before
this library is updated, you can use `send_command()` to send arbitrary commands to Redis.

All commands are sent as multi-bulk commands.  `args` can either be an Array of arguments, or individual arguments,
or omitted completely.

## TODO

Need to implement PUBLISH/SUBSCRIBE

Need to implement WATCH/UNWATCH

Add callback for MULTI completion.

Support variable argument style for MULTI commands.

Stream binary data into and out of Redis.


## Also

This library still needs a lot of work, but it is useful for many things.
There are other Redis libraries available for node, and they might work better for you.
